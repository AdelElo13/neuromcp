## [0.16.0] — 2026-04-20

### Added — Retrieval attribution + critic-scored usefulness

Codex's brutal critique of speculative reflection: before synthesizing
insights, learn which memories actually help. v0.16.0 implements the
foundation.

- **New table `retrieval_events`** — every `search_memory` call logs the
  query + retrieved IDs + optional cited IDs + outcome label
  (helpful/neutral/harmful). Timestamped, queryable, auditable.
- **New table `memory_usefulness`** — per-memory running counts of
  helpful vs harmful citations, with a Laplace-smoothed `usefulness_score`
  in [0, 1]. Default 0.5 at zero observations so brand-new memories
  participate neutrally.
- **`log_retrieval` tool** — MCP tool for recording a retrieval event
  manually. Usually called implicitly (see auto-log below).
- **`cite_memories` tool** — attach a late verdict to a previously-logged
  event. Use when the agent answers first and a critic pass scores the
  answer afterward.
- **`usefulness_stats` tool** — list memories ranked by observed
  usefulness. Inspect what the agent actually leans on.
- **Auto-log in `search_memory`** — every hybrid search now records a
  `retrieval_event` automatically and returns `retrieval_event_id`
  alongside the results. Zero-config integration for agent loops.
- **Usefulness prior in search ranker** — the hybrid score is multiplied
  by `0.5 + usefulness_score`. A memory with score 1.0 gets a 50% lift;
  one with 0.0 takes a 50% penalty. Unobserved memories are unchanged.
- **`decayUsefulness` helper** — linear half-life decay toward
  `decay_floor` (0.5 by default). Prevents permanent lock-in from
  ancient verdicts.

### Added — Verbatim session archive backfill

- **`scripts/backfill-verbatim.mjs`** — imports all raw session
  transcripts from `~/.neuromcp/raw/sessions/` into the `verbatim`
  FTS5 table. Idempotent via SHA-256 content hash. Enables literal
  recall across the entire session history.

### Migration

- Schema v8 → v9: adds `retrieval_events` + `memory_usefulness`
  tables. Existing DBs auto-migrate on startup with pre-migration
  backup at `memory.db.backup-v8`.

### Verified

- 271 / 271 tests pass (was 265; 6 new attribution tests)
- MCP server reports `v0.16.0` on startup; exposes 41 tools (was 38)
- Real-world smoke test: `search_memory` on user's 932-session corpus
  returns results + `retrieval_event_id`, event persisted to DB
- Auto-log latency: <1 ms overhead per search call

## [0.15.0] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Rescue script for rejected batches** (`scripts/rescue-rejected.py`).
  Parses the `> REJECTED — ...` reason, strips the unsupported claims
  from the summary, appends the cleaned content to the target wiki page,
  and archives the original file. No LLM calls — pure text surgery. Runs
  automatically after each consolidation pass.
- **Auto entity-linker** (`scripts/entity-linker.py`). Scans every wiki
  page for bare-word mentions of other registered entities
  (people/, projects/, systems/) and unions them into the page's
  `related:` frontmatter. Turns the wiki into a light knowledge graph
  without a separate graph database.
- **Auto index rebuilder** (`scripts/rebuild-index.py`). Generates
  `index.md` plus per-category `-index.md` files. Categories over 10
  pages are auto-split so `index.md` stays compact (the router loaded
  into every Claude session).
- **Consolidator prompt hardening.** The per-batch consolidation prompt
  now explicitly forbids: version numbers not quoted from sources, tier
  labels, roadmap speculation, decision rationales not in sources, root
  cause hypotheses, cross-references like `(zie boven)`, and any numbers
  not quoted from sources.
- **Auto-strip retry on audit rejection.** When `audit_summary` flags
  specific unsupported claims, `consolidate_batch` now strips those
  lines and re-audits once. If the stripped version passes, the clean
  summary is written. Prevents losing an entire batch over one or two
  speculative lines.

### Fixed
- **Auto-capture hook reliability.** `templates/hooks/neuromcp-auto-capture.js`
  no longer requires the `CLAUDE_HOOK_EVENT` env var — it now reads
  `hook_event_name` from the Stop payload on stdin, matching how
  current Claude Code runtimes dispatch hooks. Falls back to
  transcript-presence when neither signal is available.

### Changed
- **Consolidation runner orchestrates post-processing.**
  `scripts/run-consolidation.sh` now calls, in order:
  `consolidate-sessions.py` → `rescue-rejected.py` → `entity-linker.py`
  → `rebuild-index.py`. Each step is isolated (`|| true`) so a failure
  downstream does not block consolidation of new sessions.
